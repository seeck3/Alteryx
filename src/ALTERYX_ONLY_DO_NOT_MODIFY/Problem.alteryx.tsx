          We want you to build a web application to maintain and visualize an
          artificial portfolio containing a subset of 100 possible stocks (From
          S&P 500) for the user to buy and sell from the year 2017 given a
          starting budget of $100,000. To make this easier the user can pick a
          single day to buy all of their stocks and a single day to sell all of
          their stocks given their budget.

          While we are leaving this fairly open ended there are some rough base
          requirements we’d expect any solution to have:

						'A user can see holdings in their portfolio.',
						'A user can see how a holding in their portfolio performed in 2017. This can be accomplished with an interactive chart.',
						'A user can add as many shares of as many stocks as they would like, so long as they stay under the starting budget',
						'The user should be able to update any of the above inputs and recalculate the results. These inputs should be persisted should the user return to the page at a later time.'
